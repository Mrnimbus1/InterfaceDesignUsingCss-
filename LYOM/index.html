    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <p class="emphasize">
      I wasn't jealous before we met
    </p>
    <p>
      Now every woman I see is a potential threat
    </p>
    <p class="shout">
      And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
    </p>
    <p>
      You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      But now it isn't true
    </p>
    <p>
      Now everything is new
    </p>
    <p>
      And all I've learned has overturned
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg of you
    </p>

  <section class="chorus">
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p class="shout">
      Don't go wasting your emotion
    </p>
    <p class="shout">
      Lay all your love on me
    </p>

  <section class="verse">
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p class="emphasize">
      It was like shooting a sitting duck
    </p>
    <p>
      A little small talk, a smile, and baby I was stuck
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      I still don't know what you've done with me
    </p>
    <p>
      A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      I feel a kind of fear
    </p>
    <p>
      When I don't have you near
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg you, dear
    </p>

    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
    <p class="emphasize">
      I've had a few little love affairs
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      I used to think I was sensible
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      'Cause everything is new
    </p>
    <p>
      And everything is you
    </p>
    <p class="emphasize">
      And all I've learned has overturned
    </p>
    <p>
      What can I do?
